          Sony’s new, lighter PS5 model with a smaller heatsink has been put
          through extensive testing by Gamers Nexus and Digital Foundry, and
          ultimately, it doesn’t seem that there are significant enough
          differences between the two models to seek one over the other.

          At Apple’s annual launch event this week, it revealed new iPhones,
          iPads and Apple Watches, all of which were refinements of previous
          models. What Apple didn’t release, however, was a new kind of product
          — Apple’s “next big thing” which customers hope will be extremely cool
          and investors hope will drive another decade or more of Apple growth,
          like the iPhone did before it.

          Microsoft wants you to ditch your password. For good, this time. The
          company announced in a blog post Wednesday that it will give users the
          option to access their accounts without using a password. Users can
          choose between downloading the Microsoft Authenticator app; a security
          key; a verification code sent to your phone or secondary email
          address; or Windows Hello, a biometric option that involves scanning
          your face, iris or fingerprint.

          July 21, 2021. Share Print Apple released a critical software patch to
          fix a security vulnerability that researchers said could allow hackers
          to directly infect iPhones and other Apple devices without any user
          action. Researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab said
          the security issue was exploited to plant spyware on a Saudi
          activist's iPhone. They said they had high confidence that the world's
          most infamous hacker-for-hire firm, Israel's NSO Group, was behind
          that attack.

          As we approach the September 14 Apple event, which is likely to be
          where the company announces the iPhone 13, it’s traditionally an event
          where we expect to see the release date of the latest iOS. That may
          mean you’ll be able to download iOS 15 very soon, if Apple releases it
          next week. However, iOS 15 has seen some changes since its unveiling
          at WWDC. Safari has seen its new redesign mostly reverted back to iOS
          14, and other features such as SharePlay and Universal Control now
          scheduled for a later release.
