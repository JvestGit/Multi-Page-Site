        <strong class="date">Sep. 16 2021</strong>

        <p>
          As most of you know, the chip shortage is far from over. New reports
          are indicating that the shortage could last until 2023. This is not
          only disheartening for gamers, as the chip shoratge has lead to
          shortages for graphics cards, but for a multitude of busniesses. In
          fact the car industry has been the one who was hit the hardest in all
          of this. <a href="blog-sep-16-2021.html">Read My Full Post &rarr;</a>

        <p>
          It might comes as odd that we are already looking at rumors for the
          new Nivida 40 series when the majority of people cannot even find
          their 30 series cards available, but the launch for the new 40 series
          is inching closer and closer. We are a little more than a year away
          from the launch of the new graphics cards, and rumors about the prices
          are starting to spring up.

          <a href="blog.html"> The New iPhone 13 </a>
        </h3>

        <strong class="date">Sep. 18 2021</strong>

        <p>
          Apple came in strong with their announcment of the new iPhone 13.
          While I am personally not a Apple fan, this is an exciting shake up in
          the moblie community. I am not really excited to be frank, and I have
          seen that many people online are a bit annoyed that this is basically
          the same design as the iPhone 12 and iPhone 11. The only really big
          improvement I have seen is that finally the iPhone 13 Pro will offer a
          120hz refresh rate on their phones.
